# Equivariant Collective Variables - experiments

This repo contains experimental code for collective variables discovery using equivariant deep learning methods. The code is written using jax and haiku, and simulations use OpenMM and PySAGES.

# TODO

- Move all to ecv and add typing 
- Write benchmark experiments
- LearnCV class -> main meat
- Test with alaline
